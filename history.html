                       <p>History is something that is always interesting topic to study.but 
                        the time line and reconizing those dates for specific date is not much
                         intersesting to all. so, i think we should learn history related things as easy 
                         understandable things. And as now lets get to topic of Cloud computing which is very 
                         interesting topic to study so we shall learn and study abiut history of this in easy form. 
                         Let's simplify the history of cloud computing in an easy-to-understand form: <br>
                         Imagine you have a computer at home, and you use it for everythingâ€”storing pictures, 
                         running programs, and more. Now, think about a time when people realized they could make 
                         a special kind of computer in a far-away place that everyone could share. <br><br>
                         This special computer could store your pictures, run your programs, and you could access 
                         it from anywhere using the internet.This idea started to take shape in the early 2000s 
                         when a company called Amazon introduced a service called Amazon Web Services (AWS).
                          It was like a big virtual warehouse of computers that people could use for various
                           tasks. This was the beginning of what we now call cloud computing. <br><br>
                           So, in simple terms, cloud computing is like having a magical computer in the
                            sky that you and many others can use without having to worry about where it 
                            physically exists. This idea has grown over the years, and now, cloud computing
                             is a fundamental part of how we store data, run applications, and connect 
                             to the digital world.</p><hr>
